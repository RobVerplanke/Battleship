// Create the main loop, the game loop should set up a new game by creating Players and Gameboards.
// You need methods to render the gameboards and to take user input for attacking.
// For attacks, let the user click on a coordinate in the enemy Gameboard.


// The game loop should step through the game turn by turn using only methods from other objects.
// If at any point you are tempted to write a new function inside the game loop, step back and figure out
// which class or module that function should belong to.

// Create conditions so that the game ends once one playerâ€™s ships have all been sunk. This function is appropriate for the Game module.
